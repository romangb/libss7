libss7:
=======

libss7 is a userspace library that is used for providing SS7 protocol
services to applications.  It has a working MTP2, MTP3, and ISUP for
ITU and ANSI style SS7, however it was written in a manner that will easily
allow support for other various national specific variants
in the future.  For a working reference implementation, see the various
link test programs, as well as the Asterisk Open Source PBX.

License:
========
libss7 is covered under the GPL (Gnu Public License) version 2.  For more
information, see http://www.gnu.org/

Tested Switches:
================
Siemens EWSD - (ITU style) MTP2 and MTP3 comes up, ISUP inbound and outbound calls work as well.
DTI DXC 4K - (ANSI style) 56kbps link, MTP2 and MTP3 come up, ISUP inbound and outbound calls work as well.


Thanks:
=======
Mark Spencer, for writing Asterisk and libpri and being such a great friend and boss.

Luciano Ramos, for donating a link in getting the first "real" ITU switch working.

Collin Rose and John Lodden, John for introducing me to Collin, and Collin for the first
"real" ANSI link and for holding my hand through the remaining changes that had to be 
done for ANSI switches.

To Use:
=======
Currently, to use it with asterisk you need to check out a special branch as follows:
svn co http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/team/mattf/asterisk-ss7

In zaptel.conf, your signalling channel should be a "dchan" and your bearers should
be set as "bchan".

In the asterisk-ss7 branch, there is a sample zapata.conf that is installed which
contains sample configuration for setting up an E1 link.

Completed:
==========
MTP2 - Retransmissions are done correctly now from both sides.
Basic MTP3
Basic call messages (IAM, ACM, ANM, REL, RLC)
CIC Reset (GRS, GRA, RSC)
Connect message (CON)
CIC Blocking/Unblocking (CGB, CGBA, CGU, CGUA, BLO, BLA)
Continuity Check (COT, CCR)
Call Progress message (CPG)
ANSI MTP2, MTP3, and ISUP, inbound and outbound calling works now.
ITU style SS7 support
ANSI-style signalling support

TODO:

short term:
SUS/RES
CPG

long term:
SCCP support
