libss7:
=======

libss7 is a userspace library that is used for providing SS7 protocol
services to applications.  It has a working MTP2, MTP3, and ISUP for
ITU and ANSI style SS7, however it was written in a manner that will easily
allow support for other various national specific variants
in the future.  For a working reference implementation, see the various
link test programs, as well as the Asterisk Open Source PBX.

License:
========
libss7 is covered under the GPL (Gnu Public License) version 2.  For more
information, see http://www.gnu.org/

To Use:
=======
Currently, to use it with asterisk you need to check out a special branch as follows:
svn co http://svn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/team/mattf/asterisk-ss7

In zaptel.conf, your signalling channel should be a "dchan" and your bearers should
be set as "bchan".

In the asterisk-ss7 branch, there is a sample zapata.conf that is installed which
contains sample configuration for setting up an E1 link.

Completed:
==========
MTP2
Basic MTP3
Basic call messages (IAM, ACM, ANM, REL, RLC)
CIC Reset (GRS, GRA, RSC)
Connect message (CON)
CIC Blocking/Unblocking (CGB, CGBA, CGU, CGUA, BLO, BLA)
Continuity Check (COT, CCR)
Call Progress message (CPG)
ANSI MTP2, MTP3, and almost done with ISUP

TODO:
=====

short term:
SUS/RES
CPG

long term:
ANSI-style signalling support
SCCP support

lists (I monitor them regularly) or email me directly.
